# Code Review Ledger Templates

Use these templates for `Large` reviews, repair-enabled loops, or work that must survive context compression. Keep agent-facing ledgers in English. Write the final `REPORT.md` in Chinese.

## 9. Reset Events

| Event | Previous baseline | New baseline | Trigger | Findings/coverage invalidated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 10. Convergence

- Repair waves used:
- Repeated failure classes:
- Non-convergence diagnosis:
- Final fresh verifier identity/framing:
- Final fresh verification result:
- Stop conditions satisfied: Yes | No
- Merge decision: mergeable | not mergeable | insufficient evidence
```

## FINDINGS.md

Start with compact indexes, then keep one stable section per root-cause finding.

```markdown
# Review Findings

## Open Findings

| ID | Severity | Decision class | Status | Root cause | Scope | Owner / decision needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Closed Findings

| ID | Severity | Closed in | Verification | Reopen trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Candidate Disposition

| Candidate | Lens | Disposition | Evidence / reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CAND-001 | Security | Disproved |  |

## REV-001 — <concise root-cause title>

- Severity: Must Fix | Should Fix | Should Plan | Track as Debt
- Decision class: Needs Decision | Agent-Fixable | External Blocker
- Status: Candidate | Open | Accepted | Repairing | Verification Failed | Closed | Risk Accepted | Deferred
- Confidence: High | Medium | Low
- First detected in round:
- Last updated in round:

### Invariant

- Authority/source:

### Trigger and proof path

1. 
2. 
3. 

### Impact

- User/business impact:
- Security/privacy/data/operations impact:
- Blast radius:
- Reversibility:

### Scope and occurrences

| Path / symbol / route | Lines or hunk | Why affected |
| --- | --- | --- |

### Evidence

- Code evidence:
- Test/runtime evidence:
- Configuration/documentation evidence:
- Contradicting evidence considered:
- Remaining uncertainty:

### Smallest credible fix direction

- 

### Frozen acceptance criteria

- [ ] Original trigger is no longer reachable or is handled correctly.
- [ ] Root cause is fixed across listed sibling paths.
- [ ] Required invariant is enforced at the correct boundary.
- [ ] Regression oracle fails before and passes after when feasible.
- [ ] No required validation, permission, or release control is weakened.

### Human decision

- Question:
- Options and consequences:
- Decision:
- Decision authority/date:

### Repair record

- Authorized IDs/wave:
- Previous head:
- Current head:
- Files/symbols changed:
- Repair explanation:
- Unrelated changes: None | <list>
- Contract or scope expansion: No | <details>

### Verification record

- Repair delta reviewed:
- Impact cone reviewed:
- Commands/results:
- Manual/runtime evidence:
- Acceptance criteria result:
- Closure rationale:
- Reopen trigger:

### History

| Round | Transition | Evidence / reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Candidate -> Open |  |
```

### Finding rules

- Never renumber an ID.
- Never delete a finding to make the open list clean.
- Add occurrences to the root cause rather than duplicating findings.
- Close only with current-head evidence.
- Mark `Risk Accepted` only with accountable human authority and bounded residual risk.
- Mark `Deferred` only with owner, ceiling, and revisit trigger.
- Reopen under the same ID when the same root cause remains or recurs.
- Create a new ID when the root cause is materially different.

## REPORT.md

```markdown
# 代码审查报告

## 审查结论

- `SECTION`：`section-accepted | section-blocked | insufficient-evidence`，并明确说明该结论不代表完整功能可合并。
- `DELTA`：`delta-verified | delta-blocked | reset-required | insufficient-evidence`。
- 中途 `INTEGRATION` checkpoint：`checkpoint-passed | checkpoint-blocked | checkpoint-insufficient-evidence`。
- 最终 `INTEGRATION`/普通审查：`mergeable | not mergeable | insufficient evidence`。

`<mode-correct verdict>`

一句话说明当前结论及最高风险。

## Status Transition Rules

Allowed finding transitions:

```text
Candidate -> Open
Open -> Accepted
Open -> Risk Accepted
Open -> Deferred
Accepted -> Repairing
Repairing -> Closed
Repairing -> Verification Failed
Verification Failed -> Repairing
Closed -> Open                 when reopen evidence appears
```

Do not transition:

- `Open -> Closed` without a repair or proof that the candidate was false. A false candidate belongs in `Candidate Disposition`, not as a closed defect.
- `Repairing -> Closed` from the repair agent’s summary alone.
- `Needs Decision -> Agent-Fixable` without recording the authoritative decision or repository evidence.
- `Deferred -> Closed` merely because the review ended.

Coverage transitions:

```text
Unknown -> Reviewed | Partial | Skipped | Needs Follow-up
Reviewed -> Invalidated        when its evidence or assumptions change
Invalidated -> Reviewed        after targeted re-verification
```
