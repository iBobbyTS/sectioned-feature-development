# R

Axis: `language`. Use only for the changed path; repository versions and confirmed authority govern.

## Match and exclusions

Changed R analysis/package/statistical transformation.

Do not select merely because a data task exists; R is a language, scientific/data work is a separate domain.

## Decisions before sectioning

- Record data classes/shapes, NA/NaN semantics, recycling/coercion and grouping assumptions at the changed boundary.
- Identify package/library and native numeric dependencies plus evaluation/environment state that affects results.
- Choose tolerances and seed/reproducibility expectations from the task; distinguish statistical validity from exact bit equality.

## Handoff and smallest useful evidence

Use a small reference dataset and edge case with actual exported/transformation code; report environment and numerical tolerance instead of overstating cross-platform determinism.

## Scope boundary

No statistical-model change, missing-value policy change or analytical conclusions beyond the approved task. No route creates a product requirement, extra review or new test framework.

## Sources and status
